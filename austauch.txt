Implementing Non-Blocking Gas Refresh
I've identified that the detection loop is still blocking on slow RPC network calls for gas prices, triggering the warnings. I'm now implementing a "Lazy Refill" pattern in the gas price cache: if a stale price exists, it will be returned immediately to the detection loop while a background task refreshes it in the network. This will reduce gasPrice phase latency from 700ms to <1ms.
